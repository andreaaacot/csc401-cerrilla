CSC 401: Advanced Web Development & Programming
Semester Project Proposal

	I will create an app that keeps track of your travels, acting as a personal journal 
	to document your different trips. In this app, you will be able to save multimedia 
	elements such as photographs, videos, and voice recordings. There will also be 
	space for taking notes and adding tips and reminders. There will also be a section
	for mapping your journey using geo-location. Lastly, there will be an option to 
	share and connect with other travel buddies.
